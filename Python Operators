# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

# Take input from user
a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform operations
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
# Division with error handling
if b != 0:
    division = a / b
else:
    division = "Undefined (cannot divide by zero)"

# Display results
print("\nResults of Basic Mathematical Operations:")
print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)



# Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

# Take user input
first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")

# Concatenate full name
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# Display greeting
print("\nHello", full_name + "! Welcome to Python programming ðŸš€")
